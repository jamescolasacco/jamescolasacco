### fadrs
**motorized faderboard for daw control**  
hardware + firmware + mappings, aiming for a “studio tool” feel, not a DIY toy

- motorized long-throw faders with touch-sensing capabilities
- teensy controller that allows usb midi and modular configurations
- goal: hands-on mixing and automation for full DAW immersion, similar to old analog consoles
repo: https://github.com/jamescolasacco/fadrs

### private work
some of my best work can’t be public because it includes internal company data, private repos, or customer info. i'm happy to talk through architecture & decisions

- internal text to sql assistant (guardrails + ux for nontechnical querying)
- secure RGA form portal (auth + workflow automation + email notifications)
- video scraping and AI processing on early-release features
